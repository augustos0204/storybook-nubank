# Nubank Design System

This design system provides a collection of reusable components styled with the Nubank theme, built on top of the ShadCN UI library and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

### Installation

The Nubank Design System is built on top of ShadCN UI, which is already set up in this project. To use the components, simply import them from the components directory:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
```

### Theme Configuration

The design system uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes a custom theme inspired by Nubank's brand colors. The theme includes:

- A primary purple color (#8A05BE) - Nubank's signature color
- A secondary dark purple color (#47457A)
- A comprehensive set of semantic colors for success, warning, and error states
- Both light and dark mode variants

## Features

- **Complete component library**: Buttons, cards, forms, and more
- **Responsive design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: All components follow WCAG guidelines
- **Theme customization**: Easy to extend or modify
- **Dark mode support**: Toggle between light and dark themes

## Design Principles

The Nubank Design System follows these core principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Clean, intuitive interfaces with minimal cognitive load
2. **Consistency**: Uniform appearance and behavior across all components
3. **Flexibility**: Components can be combined and customized to fit various needs
4. **Accessibility**: Designed to work for all users, regardless of ability

## Color System

The color system is based on Nubank's brand identity:

- **Primary**: Nubank Purple (#8A05BE)
- **Secondary**: Darker Purple (#47457A)
- **Success**: Green (#27AE60)
- **Warning**: Yellow (#F1C40F)
- **Error**: Red (#E74C3C)

Each color has multiple shades available for different UI elements and states.

## Typography

The design system uses the Inter font family with three weights:

- **Regular (400)**: For body text
- **Medium (500)**: For emphasis and UI elements
- **Bold (700)**: For headings and important elements

## Spacing

A consistent 8px spacing system is used throughout the design:

- 4px (xs)
- 8px (sm)
- 16px (md)
- 24px (lg)
- 32px (xl)
- 40px (2xl)
- 48px (3xl)

## Usage Guidelines

Each component in the documentation includes:

- Usage examples
- Props and customization options
- Accessibility considerations
- Best practices and guidelines

## Theming

The design system supports theming through CSS variables and Tailwind's theme configuration. You can customize the theme by modifying the variables in the `tailwind.config.js` file.
